# Brain-Tumor-Detection-CNN
rain Tumor Classification using Machine Learning Deep learning (subfield of machine learning) has gained prominence in almost every field where decision-making is involved in recent years, spanning economics, health care, marketing, and sales. In the field of healthcare, machine learning &amp; deep learning have shown promising results in a variety of fields, namely disease diagnosis with medical imaging, surgical robots, and boosting hospital performance.  One such application of deep learning to detect brain tumors from MRI scan images.  About Brain Tumor Classification Project In this machine learning project, we build a classifier to detect the brain tumor (if any) from the MRI scan images. By now it is evident that this is a binary classification problem. Examples of such binary classification problems are Spam or Not spam, Credit card fraud (Fraud or Not fraud).
